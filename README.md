# Installing Keras Theao Tensorflow with GPU on Windows 10

Introduction

Installing Keras, Theano, and Tensorflow to train Deep Learning models with CPU is an easy task. However, to use these libraries with the GPU, we need more time and effort. In this tutorial, I will show you a complete and step-by-step process to install the most important libraries for developing Deep Learning algorithms including Keras, Theano, and Tensorflow with GPU on Windows 10/64-bit.

Installing process

1. Install Visual Studio 2013 and Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Update 3

   1a. Download and install [Visual Studio 2013 Update 5](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532495). This framework is use as a              compiler for CUDA source code.
   
   2a. Add C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\VC\bin to your %PATH% as a environment variable.
   
2.
